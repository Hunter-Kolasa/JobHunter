Thank you for your interest in JobHunter!

# USAGE

Jobhunter allows a user to access listings hosted by the Github Jobs API and keep track of potential choices in a saved jobs list.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1) Navigate to JobHunterAPI in command line
2) Run `bundle install` then `rails s`
3) Run `cd ../jobhunter-client`
4) Run `npm install` then `yarn start`

Once the server is running, the webpage will open
           -or-
5) Navigate to https://localhost3001/

# FUNCTIONALITY

A user is greeted by the home page, with any existing saved jobs listed in the left sidebar.  From there the user can navigate to the jobs tab via either the navigation bar(top left) or the `Begin your Hunt!` link on the home page.  A user can browse all jobs hosed by Githhub or search for specific keywords in the searchbar.  Upon finding a job of interest, users can begin the application process through the included link and/or save the job via a button at the end of each listing, adding the job information to the Rails API server and updating the saved list.  Each saved job has the option to remove it from the list via the `X` on the right side of the saved listing.
